## Projects

Here are some of the key projects that I have worked on or still working on:

### 1. Freecarve
• This project was carried out as part of the Object-Oriented Software Engineering course at Université Laval. The mandate was to develop, for Université Laval’s lab-factory, software capable of configuring a board and allowing the user to define cuts, which would then be performed by the lab-factory's CNC cutting machine.
**Technologies Used:** Java<br>

### 2. Linear Algebra Pedagogical Tool
• With the help of two colleagues, I developed an application that can solve linear algebra problems and give a detailed
step-by-step solution. The purpose of this tool was to help students better understand their linear algebra course.
